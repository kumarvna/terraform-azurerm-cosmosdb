# CosmosDB Account Terraform Module

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS). To use Azure Cosmos DB, initially create an Azure Cosmos account and then databases, containers, items under it. This terraform module helps quickly create a cosmosDB account with cosmosdb table, SQL database and containers resources.

> **[!NOTE]**
> **This module now supports the meta arguments including `providers`, `depends_on`, `count`, and `for_each`.**

### Resource Group

By default, this module will not create a resource group and the name of an existing resource group to be given in an argument `resource_group_name`. If you want to create a new resource group, set the argument `create_resource_group = true`.

> [!NOTE]
> *If you are using an existing resource group, then this module uses the same resource group location to create all resources in this module.*

## **`key_vault_key_id`** -  Configure customer-managed keys with Azure Key Vault

Data stored in your Azure Cosmos account is automatically and seamlessly encrypted with keys managed by Microsoft (service-managed keys). Optionally, you can choose to add a second layer of encryption with keys you manage (customer-managed keys).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, customer-managed keys are available only for new Azure Cosmos accounts. You should configure them during account creation.
> When referencing an `key_vault_key_id` in the module, use `versionless_id` instead of `id`

## **`consistency_policy`** - Consistency levels in Azure Cosmos DB

Distributed databases that rely on replication for high availability, low latency, or both, must make a fundamental tradeoff between the read consistency, availability, latency, and throughput as defined by the PACLC theorem. Azure Cosmos DB offers five well-defined levels. From strongest to weakest, the levels are: Strong, Bounded staleness, Session, Consistent prefix, Eventual. The consistency levels are region-agnostic and are guaranteed for all operations regardless of the region from which the reads and writes are served, the number of regions associated with your Azure Cosmos account, or whether your account is configured with a single or multiple write regions.

This option is not enabled by default and can be included in the terraform plan by specifiing following arguments with `consistency_policy` object.

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`consistency_level`|The Consistency Level to use for this CosmosDB Account - can be either `BoundedStaleness`, `Eventual`, `Session`, `Strong` or `ConsistentPrefix`.
`max_interval_in_seconds`|When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the time amount of staleness (in seconds) tolerated. Accepted range for this value is `5` - `86400` (1 day). Defaults to `5`. Required when `consistency_level` is set to `BoundedStaleness`.
`max_staleness_prefix`|When used with the Bounded Staleness consistency level, this value represents the number of stale requests tolerated. Accepted range for this value is `10` â€“ `2147483647`. Defaults to `100`. Required when `consistency_level` is set to `BoundedStaleness`.

> [!NOTE]
> `max_interval_in_seconds` and `max_staleness_prefix` can only be set to custom values when `consistency_level` is set to `BoundedStaleness` - otherwise they will return the default values shown above.

## **`geo_location`** - Distribute your data globally

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database system that allows you to read and write data from the local replicas of your database. Azure Cosmos DB transparently replicates the data to all the regions associated with your Cosmos account.

This option is not enabled by default and can be included in the terraform plan by specifiing following arguments with `failover_locations` object.

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`location`|The name of the Azure region to host replicated data.
`failover_priority`|The failover priority of the region. A failover priority of `0` indicates a write region. The maximum value for a failover priority = (total number of regions - 1). Failover priority values must be unique for each of the regions in which the database account exists. Changing this causes the location to be re-provisioned and cannot be changed for the location with failover priority `0`.
`zone_redundant`|Should zone redundancy be enabled for this region? Defaults to `false`.

## **`capabilities`** - The capability to enable in the CosmosDB

This option is not enabled by default and can be included in the terraform plan by specifiing `capabilities` with a valid list of strings. Accepted values are `AllowSelfServeUpgradeToMongo36`, `DisableRateLimitingResponses`, `EnableAggregationPipeline`, `EnableCassandra`, `EnableGremlin`, `EnableMongo`, `EnableTable`, `EnableServerless`, `MongoDBv3.4` and `mongoEnableDocLevelTTL`.

## **`backup`** - Configure periodic backups

Azure Cosmos DB automatically takes a full backup of your database every 4 hours and at any point of time, only the latest two backups are stored by default. If the default intervals aren't sufficient for your workloads, you can change the backup interval and the retention period using `bakup` object it supports following.

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`type`|The `type` of the backup. Possible values are `Continuous` and `Periodic`. Defaults to `Periodic`.
`interval_in_minutes`|The interval in minutes between two backups. This is configurable only when type is `Periodic`. Possible values are between `60` and `1440`.
`retention_in_hours`|The time in hours that each backup is retained. This is configurable only when type is `Periodic`. Possible values are between `8` and `720`.

## Recommended naming and tagging conventions

Applying tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name `Environment` and the value `Production` to all the resources in production.
For recommendations on how to implement a tagging strategy, see Resource naming and tagging decision guide.

>**Important** :
Tag names are case-insensitive for operations. A tag with a tag name, regardless of the casing, is updated or retrieved. However, the resource provider might keep the casing you provide for the tag name. You'll see that casing in cost reports. **Tag values are case-sensitive.**

An effective naming convention assembles resource names by using important resource information as parts of a resource's name. For example, using these [recommended naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#example-names), a public IP resource for a production SharePoint workload is named like this: `pip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001`.
